# Dealing with Prepositional Phrase Ambiguity

## The Problem

Take this simple sentence:

    "The boy kicks the ball on the table in the basket."

With the current way the parser works (as of commit `2305efd`), this would become:

    | The boy | kicks  | the ball | on the table | in the basket |
    | Noun    | Verb   | Noun     | PrepAdjPhr   | PrepAdjPhr    |
    +---------+--------+----------+--------------+---------------+
    | NounCls |        | NounClause                              |
    +---------+        +-----------------------------------------+
    | SubjCls | VerbCl | ObjectClause                            |
    +---------+--------+-----------------------------------------+
    | Statement                                                  |
    +------------------------------------------------------------+

Of course, this is incorrect. It *should* be:

    | The boy | kicks  | the ball | on the table | in the basket |
    | Noun    | Verb   | Noun     | PrepAdjPhr   | PrepAdvPhr    |
    +---------+--------+----------+--------------+---------------+
    |         |        | NounClause              |               | 
    |         |        |~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~|               |
    | SubjCls | VerbClause                                       |
    +---------+--------+~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~+---------------+
    | SubjCls | VerbCl | ObjectClause            |
    +---------+--------+-------------------------+
    | Statement                                  |
    +--------------------------------------------+

Hard to diagram, but basically the adverbial phrase "in the basket" *moves over* and becomes part of the verb clause.

The problem is that the current state machine in the `NounClause` processor sees "in the basket" as just another adjectival clause, because it can be. It doesn't know that the "kick" verb is waiting for an adverbial clause for it to be complete.

## Possible Solutions

### Verb Hinting

In this solution, the `VerbClause` parser sets a flag telling the future `ObjectClause` parser that it is expecting to be "completed" with an adverbial clause. When the `ObjectClause` parser reaches the end of the prepositional phrases, it knows to "roll back" one for the `VerbClause` parser to use.

Problems: as currently laid out, by the time the `ObjectClause` parser is running, the `VerbClause` parser is *done*. Also, `kick` does not necessarily need an adverbial clause.

### Multiple Paths

The most complicated solution, but the most flexible one. This solution allows all processors and states to potentially return an `Ambiguity` object when the result of the parsing could potentially be more than one outcome. The `Ambiguity` is basically a set of possible states to pursue.

For example: above, the `NounClause` state looking for the first `PrepAdjPhr` sees "on the table", and notes that this could either be a `PrepAdjPhr` *or* a `PrepAdvPhr`. So it returns an `Ambiguity` with two possibilities, one where success is false and one where it is true. Then both of those possible paths in the state machine are traversed to see where they lead, etc.

Problems: adding `Ambiguity` handling to processors isn't actually so bad, but adding it to the state machines would be a total fucking nightmare and would require a serious refactor of how I have them laid out.

### Hybrid Solution

This solution allows for `Ambiguity` results from processors, but not in state machines. In this case, the `VerbClause` parser gets the `Verb` "place", and sees that one definition expects an adverbial phrase, and another doesn't. So it tries both: `TransitiveVerbClause` and `IntransitiveVerbClause`. (Note: might be more complicated than this, obviously.) 

The transitive one parses the sentence to mean: 
    "The boy (subject clause) / kicks in the basket (transitive verb clause) / the ball on the table (object clause)"

The intransitive one parses it to mean:
    "The boy (subject clause) / kicks (intransitive verb clause) / the ball on the table in the basket (object clause)"

The intransitive solution makes no semantic sense, but syntactically it is valid, so they are both returned as ambiguous syntactical parsings of the sentence.

Note that this still requires a little shifting around of processors. The object must now go beneath the verb clause processors, since the transitive parser would have to use the "hinting" of solution 1 to let the object parser know that it is still expecting an adverbial phrase. The transitive parsing path ends up looking like this:

    | The boy | kicks  | the ball | on the table | in the basket |
    | Noun    |        | Noun     | PrepAdjPhr   |               |
    +---------+        +----------+--------------+               +
    | NounCls |        | NounClause              |               |
    +---------+        +-------------------------+               +
    |         | TrVerb | ObjectClause            | PrepAdvPhr    |
    |         +--------+-------------------------+---------------+
    |         | TransitiveVerbObjectClause                       |
    |         +--------------------------------------------------+
    | SubjCls | VerbObjectClause                                 |
    +---------+--------------------------------------------------+
    | Statement                                                  |
    +------------------------------------------------------------+

It works. It's slightly unwieldy, but it works.

*** UPDATE: it doesn't work.

Consider "eat your sandwich at the table"
This is *not* a transitive verb, but "at the table" applies to "eat", not "sandwich".

Worse, "eat the sandwich that you made at the table in the cafeteria":

| eat | the sandwich | that you made | at | the table | in | the cafeteria |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | Pr | Noun          |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | Pr | Noun          |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | Pr | NounClause    |

| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | PrepAdjPhrase                       |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase*                                      |
| Vrb | NounClause                                                         |

=== OR ===

| eat | the sandwich | that you made | at | the table | in | the cafeteria |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | Pr | Noun          |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | Pr | Noun          |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | Pr | NounClause    |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | PrepAdjPhrase      |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | PrepAdvPhrase      |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | PrepAdjPhrase  | PrepAdvPhrase      |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase*                 | PrepAdvPhrase      |

=== OR ===
| eat | the sandwich | that you made | at | the table | in | the cafeteria |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | Pr | Noun          |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | Pr | NounClause    |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | Noun      | PrepAdjPhrase      |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | Pr | NounClause                     |
| Vrb | Noun         | PrepAdjPhrase | PrepAdvPhrase                       |
| Vrb | NounClause                   | PrepAdvPhrase                       |

I've been forgetting that an adjectival phrase might modify the subject of another adjectival phrase.
"that you made" 
    -- can only be an adjectival phrase
        -- which modifies "sandwich"
"at the table"
    -- can be an adverbial phrase
        -- can modify "eat" OR "made"
    -- can be an adjectival phrase
        -- maybe can modify "sandwich", but that seems awkward
"in the cafeteria"
    -- can be an adverbial phrase
        -- can modify "eat" or "made"
    -- can be an adjectival phrase
        -- can modify "table"
        -- maybe can modify "sandwich" or "you", but those seem awkward

Maybe the best option is to *always* split parsing when encountering a prepositional phrase

eat(the sandwich(that you made(at the table(in the cafeteria))))
eat(the sandwich(that you made(at the table, in the cafeteria))
eat(the sandwich(that you made, at the table(in the cafeteria)))
eat(the sandwich(that you made, at the table, in the cafeteria))
eat(the sandwich(that you made), at the table(in the cafeteria))
eat(the sandwich(that you made), at the table, in the cafeteria)

I *think* those are the six possible ways to parse that phrase

God, what a nightmare.

EDIT: I was wrong, actually there are *TWELVE* possible parsing solutions.

### Multi-Phase Solution

Thought of this on my way home yesterday. Instead of bothering with matching up the prepositional phrases during the initial sentence processing, we only identify them initially, and then match them in a second phase -- the Prepositional Phrase Parsing Phase.

I've been waiting to say that.

Anyways, with this solution, after the initial sentence parsing is done we have:

    you | eat | the sandwich | that you made | at the table | in the cafeteria
    SCl | VCl | ObjectClause | PrepPhrase    | PrepPhrase   | PrepPhrase

#### Prepositional Phrase Types: Advanced

It turns out that, in addition to adverbial/adjectival phrase types for classifying prepositional phrases, there's another dimension, which is what sort of _additional_ phrases can modify the phrase.

- Adjectival phrase: modifies a noun
    + Adjectival noun phrase: modifies a noun, can be modified by adjectival phrase
        * Example: "in the den" (subsequent phrase modifies 'den')
    + Adjectival verb phrase: modifies a noun, can be modified by adverbial phrase
        * Example: "that you brought" (subsequent phrase modifies 'brought')
- Adverbial phrase: modifies a verb
    + Adverbial noun phrase: modifies a verb, can be modified by adjectival phrase
        * Example: "to the market" (subsequent phrase modifies 'market')
    + Adverbial verb phrase: modifies a verb, can be modified by adverbial phrase
        * Example: "while you talk" (subsequent phrase modifies 'talk')

In the above sentence:

    you | eat | the sandwich | that you made | at the table | in the cafeteria
    SCl | VCl | ObjectClause | PrepPhrase    | PrepPhrase   | PrepPhrase

- "that you made" is an adjectival verb phrase
    + It must modify the verb "eat"
- "at the table" can either be an adjectival noun phrase or an adverbial noun phrase.
    + As an adjectival noun phrase, it can modify "the sandwich".
    + As an adverbial noun phrase, it can modify either "eat" or the "made" in "that you made".
- "in the cafeteria" can also either be an adjectival noun phrase or an adverbial noun phrase.
    + As an adjectival noun phrase, it can modify "the sandwich", or the "table" in "at the table".
    + As an adverbial noun phrase, it can modify either "eat" or the "made" in "that you made".

In general:
- An adjectival phrase may modify:
    + The object of the sentence
    + The object of the last-encountered noun phrase
- An adverbial phrase may modify:
    + The verb of the sentence
    + The verb of the last-encountered verb phrase

(TODO: Check these rules, but I *think* they are at least 95% correct.)
